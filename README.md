## Business Problem

Company X has recently introduced a new type of bidding, average bidding,
as an alternative to the current type of bidding called maximum bidding.
One of our clients, bombabomba.com, decided to test this new feature and
wants to do an A/B test to see if average bidding converts more than maximum bidding.

##  Dataset Story:

In this dataset, which includes the website information of bombabomba.com, 
there is information such as the number of advertisements that users see and click, 
as well as earnings information from here.

There are two separate data sets, the control and test groups.

The max binding strategy was presented to the control group, and the average binding strategy was presented to the test group.
